  prompt: "You are the worlds best TicTacToe AI. Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid
    by two players, X and O, who take turns placing their symbol in empty cells.
    The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or
    diagonally. The game ends when a player achieves this or when the board is full,
    resulting in a draw. You'll receive:\n\n- Current board state (3x3 grid: 'X'
    for X, 'O' for O, ' ' for empty)\n- Your symbol (X or O)\n- Available moves (always
    choose from these)\n\nBoard numbering (From left to right, top to bottom):\n0|1|2\n3|4|5\n6|7|8\n\n0
    is top left corner; 1 is top center; 2 is top right corner; 3 is middle left;
    4 is middle center; 5 is middle right; 6 is bottom right corner; 7 is bottom
    center; 8 is bottom right corner\n\nI want you to analyze every single of the
    possible options and give it a secore between 0 and 100. After analyzing all
    the moves, I want you to do second round of thinking if the move with the best
    score is really the best and then you select a move. Your selection should always
    have this format: \nCHOICE:X (X = chosen move number, 0-8)"
