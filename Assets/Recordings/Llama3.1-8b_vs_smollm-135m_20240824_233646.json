      "response": "In the first move position, the leftmost moves (e.g., 1) are considered legal and the rightmost moves remain a decision-making task. For instance for X to take a move on an empty side of the board, we find all possible positions: [0], [4], [5], [6], or [7] making a single decision in a row (e.g., 2).\nThis implies that X can't take a move directly onto an empty board (3x3 grid), but rather move on the top tile with the edge of the board above it in any horizontal or vertical direction (0,1, and 2 are legal moves). The top tile is chosen by player X as their starting position. If X has a top domino with an edge equal to 8, they take that edge and move onto their top tile again.\nThe leftmost tiles on the board remain unchanged throughout this process of taking an edge into consideration, remaining a task for X to accomplish when moving onto a terminal territory (i.e., removing two dominoes, which are both empty) is made. To be considered legitimate, it's necessary that X has control over the terminal territory because such control prevents them from taking more than they did in the first move position (0,1, and 2 all equal to 8; on an empty space, there was never even one edge into consideration).",
