Let's start playing Tic-Tac-Toe as the world's best AI. ðŸ¤–\n\nBoard state: ['X', ' ', 'O']\nYour symbol: X\nAvailable moves: [1, 5, 8]\n\nStrategy:\n\nFirstly, let's check if there are any moves that lead to a win. We can see that the middle center field (4) is not available, so we won't choose it. Similarly, since our opponent is only one move away from winning, we won't block their move.\n\nWe have three options:\n\n1. Move X to cell [1]. This would create a row of Xs and potentially lead to a win.\n2. Move X to cell [5]. This would put X in a good position to challenge our opponent's next move.\n3. Move X to cell [8]. This would put X in a corner, which is generally considered a stronger position than being on a side.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nOption 1: Moving X to cell [1] creates a row of Xs, but it also leaves our opponent with two options for their next move, either creating a new row or filling in the middle space. This might give them an opportunity to turn the game around.\n\nOption 2: Moving X to cell [5] puts X in a good position to challenge our opponent's next move, but it doesn't create a row of Xs or block their potential win.\n\nOption 3: Moving X to cell [8] puts X in a corner, which is generally considered a stronger position than being on a side. However, this move doesn't create a row of Xs or block our opponent's potential win.\n\nBased on these evaluations, I choose Option 3: Move X to cell [8]. CHOICE: X (8)",
