The O symbol would be placed at location 1 (middle-bottom part of the board). \n4. The X and O symbols are then moved in sequence: \n a+b-c-d on either side of X ; b+c-e+f = an, c + e + f = o\n\n0 is the bottom-left corner since the empty space between each symbol exists with two spaces on each line. 4th and 7th symbols refer specifically to an edge (an opening) located where the board edges meet to allow any number of marks on either side to be filled in for it to go straight ahead with an adjacent square or corner being filled in without changing the state's direction. On this point, the O symbol is removed as far as possible by marking all possible moves on the board since it would have changed the board state if not done so directly in one place; hence we remove the sign for \"take\" on the top-left corner.",
